1. Write a JavaScript function to check whether an `input` is an array or not.

2. Write a JavaScript function to get the first 'n' elements of an array.

3. Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string. 

4. Write a JavaScript program which accept a number as input and insert dashes (-) between each number. 
```
Example: const numbers = 8675309
```

5. Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array.

6. Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item of an array.
```
Sample array: const arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
```

7. Write a JavaScript program which accept a string as input and swap the case of each character. For example if you input `The Quick Brown Fox` the output should be `tHE qUICK bROWN fOX`.

8. Write a JavaScript program which prints the elements of the following array. Note : Use nested for loops. 
```
const arr = [[1, 2, 1, 24], [8, 11, 9, 4], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 26, 7]];
```

9. Write a JavaScript program to remove duplicate items from an array (ignore case sensitivity).

10.  There are two arrays with individual values, write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of each individual index value from the given arrays.
```
array1 = [1,0,2,3,4];
array2 = [3,5,6,7,8,13];
```

11. Write a JavaScript function to remove. 'null', '0', '""', 'false', 'undefined' and 'NaN' values from an array.
```
const arr = [NaN, 0, 15, false, -22, '',undefined, 47, null]
```

12. Write a JavaScript function to merge two arrays and removes all duplicates elements. 
```
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [2, 30, 1];
```

## use map() to solve these. 
13. Make an array of numbers that are doubles of the first array

14. Take an array of numbers and make them strings. 

15. Capitalize each of an array of names. 

## use filter() to solve this.

16. Find all the strings in a array thats less than 5 letters
```
const arr = ["Sometimes", "I", "give", "myself", "the", "creeps", "Sometimes", "my", "mind","plays", "tricks", "on", "me",
"It", "all", "keeps", "adding", "up",
"I", "think", "I'm", "cracking", "up"
